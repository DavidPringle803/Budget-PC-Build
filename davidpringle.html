	    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
		  <p>When building your first PC it maybe a little daunting trying to figure out
             what parts you actually need, and if the parts that you are looking to order are compatible.		  
		     Before ordering parts, it is good to know if the parts you are ordering will be compatible ahead
			 of time. As an example, a Ryzen CPU will not be compatible with an Intel motherboard and vice versa, an Intel CPU
			 Will not operate with a Ryzen motherboard. There are many sites that will allow you to know if certain parts are 
			 compatible or not. A good site to use is <a target="_blank" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a> which will
			 not only let you know if parts are compatible but will also allow you to view the price of parts on online marketplaces 
			 such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newegg.com/">Newegg</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>.

	    <h2>Get A Budget CPU</h2>
		  <p>The first step that I would recommend when building your budget PC build is finding the right 
		     CPU (Central Processing Unit) for your needs. The CPU is known as the “brain” of the PC. It is responsible for 
		     every operation that is carried out on a computer from keystrokes, opening and closing programs, savings files, 
		     etc. There are many good CPU’s that are under 200 USD. Two major CPU manufactures are Ryzen and Intel. </p><br>
