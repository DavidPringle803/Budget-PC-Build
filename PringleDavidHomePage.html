    <h1>Building A Budget Gaming PC</h1>
	  <section class="basics">
	    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
		  <p>When building your first PC it maybe a little daunting trying to figure out
             what parts you actually need, and if the parts that you are looking to order are compatible.		  
		     Before ordering parts, it is good to know if the parts you are ordering will be compatible ahead
			 of time. As an example, a Ryzen CPU will not be compatible with an Intel motherboard and vice versa, an Intel CPU
			 Will not operate with a Ryzen motherboard. There are many sites that will allow you to know if certain parts are 
			 compatible or not. A good site to use is <a target="_blank" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a> which will
			 not only let you know if parts are compatible but will also allow you to view the price of parts on online marketplaces 
			 such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newegg.com/">Newegg</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>.

	    <h2>Get A Budget CPU</h2>
		  <p>The first step that I would recommend when building your budget PC build is finding the right 
		     CPU (Central Processing Unit) for your needs. The CPU is known as the “brain” of the PC. It is responsible for 
		     every operation that is carried out on a computer from keystrokes, opening and closing programs, savings files, 
		     etc. There are many good CPU’s that are under 200 USD. Two major CPU manufactures are Ryzen and Intel. </p><br>

	    <p>CPU's Under $200</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Intel CPU BX8070110100F Core i3-10100F $89</li>
			<li>Intel® Core™ i5-9400F $155</li>
			<li>Intel® Core™ i3-10320 $148</li>
			<li>AMD Ryzen 3 1200 AF $190</li>
			<li>AMD Ryzen 3 1200 AF $173</li>

	    <h2>Get Budget Friendly Graphics</h2>
		  <p>When ordering parts for your budget PC, you may hit a bump in the road when it comes to finding a decent graphics 
		     card that is not extremely overpriced. Most low tier graphics cards are around $300 if not more. So, you’re probably 
			 thinking. Wait a minute, so if I buy a CPU and Graphics card, I’m already spending somewhere around $400-$500 just for 
			 two components? Well, my friend there is an alternative to buying a CPU and Graphics card separately, and it’s called 
			 an iGPU. Which stands for integrated graphics processing unit. Which is a CPU that provides its own graphics which negates 
			 the need to buy a CPU and graphics card separately, lowering the cost of your build. Below I have listed a few iGPU's 
			 that you may want to consider.</p>

			 <p>Affordable iGPU's</p>
			 <ul>
			   <li>AMD Ryzen 5 5600G $240</li>
			   <li>AMD Athlon 3000G $95</li>
			   <li>Intel Core i5-9400 Desktop $183</li>
			   <li>AMD Ryzen 3 3200G $280</li>
			   <li>AMD Athlon 200GE $88</li>

	    <h2>Memorey</h2>
		  <p>Now that we have the expensive parts out of the way. Buying memory for your build is the next step. So, it is 
		     recommended that you buy dual channel RAM (i.e., at least two ram sticks). RAM (Random Access Memory) is essentially 
		     your computers short-term memory. From holding the data that you are currently using to the movement 
		     of your mouse from one side of the screen to the other. For gaming I would 
		     recommend at least 16 GB, with a minimum speed of 3000mhz. Since RAM is fairly 
			 inexpensive There is no need to list them.</p>

	  <section class="motherboard">
	    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
		  <p>Now let’s pick out a Motherboard. The purpose of the Motherboard is to provide the electrical connections by which the other components of your computer communicate. When choosing which motherboard is right for your build there are a few things you need to consider. First, is the motherboard compatible with your CPU, or iGPU. Second, can it handle the speed of your RAM. Also do you want a motherboard that comes with pre-built Wi-Fi, or are you going to connect It online by ethernet.</p>

		  <p>Recommended Motherboard Spec's</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>B450 and up</li>
			<li>Is able to handle atleast 3000mhz RAM speed</li>
			<li>Is able to handle atleast 16 GB of RAM</li>
		  </ul>

	  <section class="storage">
	  <h2>Storage</h2>
	    <p>Depending on the amount of storage that you prefer. Storage can be the most inexpensive component to your PC build. There are two types of storage. SSD (Solid State Drives), and HDD (Hard Disk Drives). They both have their pros and cons. I recommend you look at your budget and decided if you would rather have an SSD which will allow faster computer speeds, at a higher price or an HDD with slower speeds at a lower price.</p>

	  <section class="power">
	    <h2>Power Supply</h2>
		  <p>Not that you have picked out all your other components its time to choose your power supply. This is going to take a little bit of math. You will have to figure out how many watts your other components need to operate. That way you can figure out how many watts your power supply needs to be able to supply.</p>

	    <h2>Pick A Case</h2>
		  <p>At this point this is where you can get creative, and pick the beautiful home for all of your components. Also make sure your motherboard, and all other components are able to fit your desired case.</p>
